Chrome extension to de-euphemize certain common phrases and other terms throughout web browsing. For instance:

* "Police officers" becomes "Slave patrollers."
* "Police violence" becomes "lynchings."
* "Police union" becomes "domestic terrorist group."

You get the idea. :) It also adds a "toggle euphemisms" browser action button that reloads the current tab and pauses/unpauses the extension.

Please suggest new phrases and their less euphemistic counterparts!

* Long-form suggestions and bug reports: https://github.com/meitar/de-euphemizer/issues/new
* You can also tweet your suggestions @maymaymx.
