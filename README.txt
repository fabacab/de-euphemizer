Chrome extension to de-euphemize certain common phrases and other terms throughout web browsing. For instance:

* "Police officers" becomes "Slave patrollers."
* "Police violence" becomes "lynchings."

You get the idea. :) It also adds a "toggle euphemisms" browser action button that reloads the current tab and pauses/unpauses the extension.

Please suggest new phrases and their less euphemistic counterparts!
